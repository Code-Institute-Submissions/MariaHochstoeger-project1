## Bugs

- Imported Google Fonts into html via <link>. This caused css-classes and -ids to not be applied. Fixed it by removing Google Fonts link from index.html and instead importing Google Fonts into style.css.
- Fixed flexbox-styling by applying differently colored borders to better understand the individual elements' behaviours
