## Bugs

- Imported Google Fonts into html via <link>. This caused css-classes and -ids to not be applied. Fixed it by removing Google Fonts link from index.html and instead importing Google Fonts into style.css.

## Sources

- Love Running walk-through project for basic page structure, header and nav-bar
- Favicon was generated using favicon.cc
